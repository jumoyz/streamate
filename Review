Here are some recommendations to improve your app.js:

1. Code Organization & Modularity
- Split into Modules: The file is very large. Consider splitting it into modules (e.g., api.js, auth.js, admin.js, user.js, notifications.js, etc.) for maintainability.
- Reuse Components: Many UI rendering functions (e.g., for tables, cards) could be abstracted into reusable components.

2. Event Listener Management
Multiple DOMContentLoaded: You have several DOMContentLoaded listeners. Combine them into one to avoid confusion and potential race conditions.
Event Delegation: For dynamic content (e.g., notifications, subscriptions), use event delegation instead of re-attaching listeners after every render.

3. Data Attributes & Row IDs
Missing Data Attributes: In admin tables, you reference row.dataset.id, but the <tr> elements do not have a data-id attribute. Add it when rendering rows:

// filepath: d:\TMSHT.COM\Apps\StreaMate\web\V1\app.js
// ...existing code...
usersTable.innerHTML += `
    <tr data-id="${user.id}">
        ...
    </tr>
`;
// ...existing code...

4. Button Classes
Consistent Button Classes: For actions like "Edit", "Delete", "Renew", "Cancel", use unique classes (btn-edit, btn-delete, etc.) to simplify event handling and avoid conflicts.

5. Error Handling
User Feedback: Use a consistent UI for errors (e.g., a toast or modal) instead of alert(), which can be intrusive.
API Error Handling: Centralize error handling for API requests to reduce repetition.

6. Security
Input Validation: Add more robust client-side validation for forms (e.g., email format, password strength).
Sensitive Data: Never store sensitive data (like passwords) in localStorage or expose them in the frontend.

7. Performance
Reduce DOM Manipulation: Build HTML strings in memory and update the DOM once, rather than appending repeatedly in loops.
Pagination: For large tables (users, subscriptions), implement pagination or lazy loading.

8. Accessibility
ARIA Labels: Add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility, especially for dynamic content and modals.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.

9. Code Style
Consistent Formatting: Use a linter (like ESLint) and a formatter (like Prettier) to keep code style consistent.
Comments: Add more comments for complex logic, especially in admin functions.

10. Miscellaneous
Service Worker Path: Make sure the service worker path is correct (sw.js should be at the root or adjust the path).
Chart.js: Destroy and re-create charts properly to avoid memory leaks.

Summary:
Your code is functional and covers many features, but splitting it into modules, improving event handling, and enhancing UI/UX will make it more maintainable and scalable. Consider these recommendations as you continue development!

For code organization and modularity, I've splitted app.js into 10 modules: 
api.js - codes already generated, need your review
auth.js - codes already generated, need your review
admin.js - codes already generated, need your review
user.js - codes already generated, need your review
ui.js - generate codes
main.js - generate codes
utils.js - generate codes
notifications.js - generate codes
news.js - generate codes
charts.js - generate codes
